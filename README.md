# NTC_Thermistor_Calibrator
Arduino-based board that can plug 8 NTCs into it, with one of them being a fancy calibrated one.  Then all 8 can be bolted to a piece of metal, and heated with the onboard heater.  The fancy thermistor can be used as a reference, and the other 8 can have their data printed over the USB connection for calibration over the temperature range.
